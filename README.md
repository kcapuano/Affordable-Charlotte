# Affordable-Charlotte



For most people, moving to a new city presents many challenges. One of these challenges is finding suitable housing that meets specific criteria, commonly housing prices and location in relation to the workplace. Our project aims to provide a solution to this challenge. Our mapping tool will assist users in finding suitable locations to live based on several select metrics, including price and proximity to a certain location or address in the Charlotte area.
